# app-deploy-repo
This is a repo for FIS students to clone and use for heroku deployment.

Text in the FlaskDeploy.ipynb is out of date, heroku no longer takes older versions of Python. requirements.txt and runtime.txt have been updated accordingly, FlaskDeploy.ipynb to be updated when I get a chance.
